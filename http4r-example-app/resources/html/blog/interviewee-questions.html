    <span>interviewee questions ⬇️</span>

        We often think about preparing for job interviews so that we as candidates come across as well as we can. But we
        rarely think of the best questions that we can ask employers. I have been on the hiring side far more often than
        not, and in my experience it has been rare to be grilled on my team or company or culture. This is a shame! We
        should strive for an honest conversation about whether this is the right role for people on both sides of the
        table. People don't want to work somewhere they don't enjoy, and employers should not want to hire people who
        will quickly leave when they figure out it's not what they expected.

        <span>list of questions ⬇️</span>
        <div class="mb-4">
            So I will lay out a list of questions that I think are good for candidates to ask potential employers. You
            need to figure out what you care about most and pick the questions you want to ask in order of their
            importance to you. If not all of them are adequately answered in the interview, follow up with an email and
            ask the company to add more detail, or ask to speak to someone on the team you will join. If they do not
            know what team you will join, this is a sign that hiring is not entirely joined up with Engineering. Teams
            know best what they need and if hires are not done for teams then that's a sign that Engineering struggle to
            influence ways of working in the wider business to suit their needs and it's probably not a Tech-led
            company.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            Each question will have a sub-section that explains the thinking behind it and what a good and bad answer to
            the question might look like from the interviewer.

                        d) whether there is trust: it's extremely difficult to know how well teams are performing, but
                        you can ask Engineers if they think they are, if they're happy, if people stay for a long time,
                        if there is a good culture, if they are beating their competition, and if the
                        <a href="accelerate">accelerate</a> metrics are being used

            So I will describe what it means to me and what I value. Let's take a look at the manifesto's main statement
            in full:
        </div>
        <div class="quote pl-2 mb-4">
            <div class="mb-4"><i>
                We are uncovering better ways of developing
                software by doing it and helping others do it.
                Through this work we have come to value:
            </i></div>
            <div class="mb-4">
                <ul>
                    <li class="mb-4"><i><span class="text-base">Individuals and interactions</span> over processes and
                        tools</i>

                    <li class="mb-4"><i><span class="text-base">Working software</span> over comprehensive documentation</i>

                    </li>

            </div>
            <div>
                <i>
                    That is, while there is value in the items on
                    the right, we value the items on the left more.
                </i>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            Before looking at the four values, the two contextualising comments at the start and end already tell us a
            lot.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col mt-2 doc-font block w-4/5 md:w-2/3 2xl:w-2/5 collapsible">
        <span>contextual comments ⬇️</span>

        <div class="mb-4">
            The opening contextual comment says that better ways of developing software are being uncovered through
            "doing it" and
            "helping others to do it", it is <b><u>not</u></b> through naval-gazing or armchair-architecting or managing
            teams but
            through actually developing software. That is to say that while there is value in a lot of the "overhead"
            roles,
            if we want to uncover better ways of <b><u>developing software</u></b> there is <b><u>more</u></b> value in
            "doing it".
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            The closing contextual comment for me summarises why this stuff is so hard to get right and what the vast
            majority
            of people misunderstand about agile and systems thinking. For me, it is the biggest epiphany I had in
            systems thinking:
            every system has trade-offs and bottlenecks, it's about choosing which ones you want in order to optimise
            for certain outcomes;
            therefore nothing comes for free in your system - every process you have is another process you do not have,
            every way of working
            is some other way of working you're not following, the culture* you have is some other culture you do not
            have...etc. *In fact, culture is
            something best stated as what it is <b><u>over</u></b> what it is <b><u>not</u></b>!
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            So what does the closing comment say? It acknowledges there is value in the items on the right: processes
            and tools have value,
            documentation has value etc. But it is doing what any good definition of a value does: values one thing over
            another. And
            this is where the misunderstanding arises - these things are in tension! You can do a bit of both, sure, but
            you cannot do both of
            these things to the max.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            If you value Individuals and interactions <b><u>over</u></b> processes and tools that means you would take a
            quick conversation <b><u>over</u></b> asking someone to fill in a spreadsheet, it means that the last
            conversation you had about a
            thing is the truth <b><u>over</u></b> what it says in some issue tracker, it means that you would go and
            speak to another person in
            another team about a thing <b><u>over</u></b> setting up a meeting with all possibly relevant people or
            perhaps raising a ticket in a
            week-long queue to some "team" in a basement (or even just across the room!).
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            So what do most people get wrong? Yes, there is value in the things on the right. Writing docs will <b><u>feel
            useful</u></b> because
            there is some value in it. Having a plan is <b><u>often useful</u></b> if not only to force us to think.
            Etc. <b><u>But</u></b> there
            is <b><u>more value</u></b> in the things on the left, and they are at odds with each other. So yes, we can
            plan things <b><u>but</u></b> in
            light of new information there is more value in "responding to change" <b><u>over</u></b> "following our
            plan". Yes, we can have some docs but we
            cannot expect them to be the source of truth or imply that our software does what the docs say, because they
            can only ever be
            secondary to the code itself. So there is more value in spending time writing good software
            <b><u>over</u></b> writing good docs that
            explain what the software should do. Etc.

        <span>individual and interactions ⬇️</span>

        <div class="mb-4">
            ...over processes and tools. The first value is my favourite. Work is so much more fun when we work as a
            team
            with a high amount of trust because ultimately everything comes down to trust.
