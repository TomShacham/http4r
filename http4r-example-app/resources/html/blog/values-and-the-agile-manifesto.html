    <span>values and the agile manifesto ⬇️</span>

        I'd like to say what I value, but the agile manifesto does such a good job of it, so I will just describe what
        it means to me and add a few things.

    <div class="flex flex-col mt-4 doc-font block w-4/5 md:w-2/3 2xl:w-2/5 collapsible">
        <span>values ⬇️</span>
        <div class="mb-4">Values should prioritise one thing over another, which is how the <a
                href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a> is written.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            It seems the vast majority of people working in Tech nowadays don't know that capital "A" Agile is not the
            same as "agile" ie. to actually work in an "agile" way.
            Agile has become a way for people to sell consulting to companies wanting to evolve their ways of working.
            But Agile™ is rarely agile as it is described in the manifesto above
            back in 2001. It has become a buzzword.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            And broadly speaking, people have taken it to mean "don't think too much about stuff, just do things
            and then reflect on them".
            Or maybe it's more process oriented and is something like "follow the 'rules' of <i>&lt;insert Agile
            methodology&gt;</i> and your software will be great and business prosper".

    </div>

        <span>agile manifesto ⬇️</span>
        <div class="mb-4">
            But I keep coming back to it and resonating with it even more. There is so much knowledge distilled into it.
            But it is also nuanced and can seem anodyne to someone who doesn't know much about Tech.
            "Of course I value Individuals and interactions!" I hear you say.
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
            So I will describe what it means to me and what I value. Let's take a look at the manifesto's main statement
            in full:
        </div>
        <div class="quote pl-2 mb-4">
            <div class="mb-4"><i>
                We are uncovering better ways of developing
                software by doing it and helping others do it.
                Through this work we have come to value:
            </i></div>
            <div class="mb-4">
                <ul>
                    <li class="mb-4"><i><span class="text-base">Individuals and interactions</span> over processes and
                        tools</i>
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-4"><i><span class="text-base">Working software</span> over comprehensive documentation</i>
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-4"><i><span class="text-base">Customer collaboration</span> over contract negotiation</i>
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-4"><i><span class="text-base">Responding to change</span> over following a plan</i>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <i>
                    That is, while there is value in the items on
                    the right, we value the items on the left more.
                </i>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            Before looking at the four values, the two contextualising comments at the start and end already tell us a
            lot.
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col mt-2 doc-font block w-4/5 md:w-2/3 2xl:w-2/5 collapsible">
        <span>contextual comments ⬇️</span>

        <div class="mb-4">
            The opening contextual comment says that better ways of developing software are being uncovered through
            "doing it" and
            "helping others to do it", it is <b><u>not</u></b> through naval-gazing or armchair-architecting or managing
            teams but
            through actually developing software. That is to say that while there is value in a lot of the "overhead"
            roles,
            if we want to uncover better ways of <b><u>developing software</u></b> there is <b><u>more</u></b> value in
            "doing it".
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            The closing contextual comment for me summarises why this stuff is so hard to get right and what the vast
            majority
            of people misunderstand about agile and systems thinking. For me, it is the biggest epiphany I had in
            systems thinking:
            every system has trade-offs and bottlenecks, it's about choosing which ones you want in order to optimise
            for certain outcomes;
            therefore nothing comes for free in your system - every process you have is another process you do not have,
            every way of working
            is some other way of working you're not following, the culture* you have is some other culture you do not
            have...etc. *In fact, culture is
            something best stated as what it is <b><u>over</u></b> what it is <b><u>not</u></b>!
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            So what does the closing comment say? It acknowledges there is value in the items on the right: processes
            and tools have value,
            documentation has value etc. But it is doing what any good definition of a value does: values one thing over
            another. And
            this is where the misunderstanding arises - these things are in tension! You can do a bit of both, sure, but
            you cannot do both of
            these things to the max.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            If you value Individuals and interactions <b><u>over</u></b> processes and tools that means you would take a
            quick conversation <b><u>over</u></b> asking someone to fill in a spreadsheet, it means that the last
            conversation you had about a
            thing is the truth <b><u>over</u></b> what it says in some issue tracker, it means that you would go and
            speak to another person in
            another team about a thing <b><u>over</u></b> setting up a meeting with all possibly relevant people or
            perhaps raising a ticket in a
            week-long queue to some "team" in a basement (or even just across the room!).
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            So what do most people get wrong? Yes, there is value in the things on the right. Writing docs will <b><u>feel
            useful</u></b> because
            there is some value in it. Having a plan is <b><u>often useful</u></b> if not only to force us to think.
            Etc. <b><u>But</u></b> there
            is <b><u>more value</u></b> in the things on the left, and they are at odds with each other. So yes, we can
            plan things <b><u>but</u></b> in
            light of new information there is more value in "responding to change" <b><u>over</u></b> "following our
            plan". Yes, we can have some docs but we
            cannot expect them to be the source of truth or imply that our software does what the docs say, because they
            can only ever be
            secondary to the code itself. So there is more value in spending time writing good software
            <b><u>over</u></b> writing good docs that
            explain what the software should do. Etc.

            ...over processes and tools. The first value is my favourite. Work is so much more fun when we work as a team
            with a high amount of trust because ultimately everything comes down to trust.
