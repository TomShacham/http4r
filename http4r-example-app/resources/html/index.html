        I enjoy hard technical challenges and their intersection with Product-thinking, Systems-thinking and broader business and management
        strategy. Great things happens when teams are trusted and empowered to build good quality products, experiment and learn. The
        individual contributor model of ownership breaks down quickly for any moderately hard problem and businesses should go after
        problems that are hard to solve.

        I'd like to say what I value, but the agile manifesto does such a good job of it, so I will just describe what it means to me.
    </div>
    <div class="doc-font block w-4/5 md:w-2/3 2xl:w-2/5">
        <div class="mb-4">Values should prioritise one thing over another, which is how the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a> is written.</div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            It seems the vast majority of people working in Tech nowadays don't know that capital "A" Agile is not the same as "agile" ie. to actually work in an "agile" way.
            Agile has become a way for people to sell consulting to companies wanting to evolve their ways of working. But Agileâ„¢ is rarely agile as it is described in the manifesto above
            back in 2001. It has become a buzzword.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            And I think broadly speaking, people have taken it to mean "don't think too much about stuff, just do things and then reflect on them".
            Or maybe it's more process oriented and is something like "follow the 'rules' of <i>&lt;insert Agile methodology&gt;</i> and your software will be great and business prosper".
        </div><div class="mb-4">
        But I keep coming back to it and resonating with it even more. There is so much knowledge distilled into it.
        But it is also nuanced and can seem anodyne to someone who doesn't know much about Tech.
        "Of course I value Individuals and interactions!" I hear you say.
    </div>
        <div class="mb-4">So I will describe what it means to me and what I value:</div>
        <div class="mb-4">Firstly:</div>
        <div class="mb-4"><i>We are uncovering better ways of developing
            software by doing it and helping others do it.
            Through this work we have come to value:
