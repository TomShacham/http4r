        I like to work in highly-collaborative, high-trust teams doing Trunk-Based Development.
        I like cross-functional teams, where every role is a hat to be worn rather than a gate to be kept.

        I'd like to say what I value, but the agile manifesto does such a good job of it, so I will just describe what it means to me.
    </div>
    <div class="doc-font block w-4/5 md:w-2/3 2xl:w-2/5">
        <div class="mb-4">Values should prioritise one thing over another, which is how the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a> is written.</div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            It seems the vast majority of people working in Tech nowadays don't know that capital "A" Agile is not the same as "agile" ie. to actually work in an "agile" way.
            Agile has become a way for people to sell consulting to companies wanting to evolve their ways of working. But Agileâ„¢ is rarely agile as it is described in the manifesto above
            back in 2001. It has become a buzzword.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
            And I think broadly speaking, people have taken it to mean "don't think too much about stuff, just do things and then reflect on them".
            Or maybe it's more process oriented and is something like "follow the 'rules' of <i>&lt;insert Agile methodology&gt;</i> and your software will be great and business prosper".
        </div><div class="mb-4">
        But I keep coming back to it and resonating with it even more. There is so much knowledge distilled into it.
        But it is also nuanced and can seem anodyne to someone who doesn't know much about Tech.
        "Of course I value Individuals and interactions!" I hear you say.
    </div>
        <div class="mb-4">So I will describe what it means to me and what I value:</div>
        <div class="mb-4">Firstly:</div>
        <div class="mb-4"><i>We are uncovering better ways of developing
            software by doing it and helping others do it.
            Through this work we have come to value:
        </i></div>
        <ul>
            <li class="mb-4"><b class="text-base">1</b> Quality code (going slow to go fast)</li>
            <li class="mb-4"><b class="text-base">2</b> Continuous Delivery</li>
            <li class="mb-4"><b class="text-base">3</b> Symmetric client and server ie. both are Http Handlers</li>
            <li class="mb-4"><b class="text-base">4</b> This makes it very easy to sub in and out dependencies eg a
                FakeThirdPartyClient {}
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4"><b class="text-base">5</b> All of the above make it highly testable, so we can easily TDD
                our apps
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4"><b class="text-base">6</b> Even better, we can compile our App to WASM and run unit tests
                in the browser.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-4"><b class="text-base">7</b> It is blazingly fast and uses minimal dependencies. Spin up a server and run a test in 1ms.</li>
            <li class="mb-4"><b class="text-base">8</b> It is synchronous for the sake of simplicity - if you think you
                need async, you probably don't.
